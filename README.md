SenSi
=====

SenSi, pronounced Sense See, in a Visual Attention Model Framework written in C++. Using the framework, attention models, emulation the human vision, can be constructed to determine the focus of attention. Such models are useful for, e.g. equiping robots with artificial vision.

SenSi is designed with flexibility in mind. The interfaces employed are fairly intuitive, allowing easy extension of the framework. For more information, see the extending the framework page.
